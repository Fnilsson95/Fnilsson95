## Hey there!

I'm a student enrolled in the Software Engineering and Management (SEM) program at Gothenburg University.
I am currently working on **STIP – Stockholm Transport Intelligence System**, a project for the course DIT826 – Data Intensive AI.

STIP is a data-driven application that integrates real-time and historical public transport data from Stockholm (SL).
The goal is to provide users with intelligent features such as delay predictions, route insights, and improved travel information by combining machine learning, backend services, and a modern frontend.
